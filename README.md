## My_work

I focused on the spotify API and the Auth2 management, I had a lot of difficulties managing the token and identifying the ways to retrieve the tokens and store them. Not entirely sure if i did it correctly but it works.

I also worked on the first drag n drop, it is not perfect but it is what it is...
